# royal-tetris
We created an online tetris in order to play in multiplayer. The aim of the game is to have few player playing on the same grid. We used RMI to create the server and to have an serveur "easy" to configure. The main difficulty is to solved collision problems.


In order to launch the server : execute Server.java in Server/src/main/java/game/tetris
